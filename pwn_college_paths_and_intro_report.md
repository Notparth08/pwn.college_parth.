# Overview

This report documents a set of introductory pwn.college levels focused on basic Linux command invocation, path types (absolute vs relative), shell expansion (tilde `~`), and simple use of the command history. It includes challenge descriptions, the solutions used, thought process, and takeaways that will help future readers understand how to approach similar beginner challenges.

# Challenges Covered

1. **Invoking a program at root** — execute the program `/pwn` to obtain a flag.
2. **Invoking a program in a subdirectory** — execute `/challenge/run` to obtain a flag.
3. **Using an absolute path that expands from `~`** — use a short (≤3 chars pre-expansion) path such as `~/x` so the shell expands it to an absolute path inside the home directory (`/home/hacker/x`).
4. **Executing a program using a relative path from `/`** — change the current working directory (cwd) and run `./...` or a relative path that starts with `c` (hint provided by the level) to reach `/challenge/run`.
5. **Using `.` in paths** — demonstrate that `.` refers to the current directory and can appear in paths like `./challenge` and `challenge/.` without changing the resolved location.
6. **Command history** — use the up-arrow to fetch prior commands and discover a flag printed earlier.

# My Solves

### Level: Execute `/pwn`
**Goal:** Run the binary located at `/` named `pwn`.

**Solution (bash):**
```bash
/pwn
```
**Flag obtained:** `pwn.college{helloworld}`

**Thought process:** The binary lives at the filesystem root. Invoking it requires an absolute path that begins with `/` — so we call `/pwn`. If the program printed nothing or returned an error, I would inspect `/` with `ls -l /` and run `file /pwn` and `ls -l /pwn` to check existence, type, and permissions.

---

### Level: Execute `/challenge/run`
**Goal:** Run the challenge program named `run` located in `/challenge`.

**Solution (bash):**
```bash
/challenge/run
```
**If the program expects an argument that writes the flag to a file in your home directory:**
```bash
/challenge/run ~/x
cat ~/x
```

**Thought process:** The `run` program is in `/challenge`, so the absolute path is `/challenge/run`. If an argument is required, the level stated that the argument must be an absolute path inside the home directory and be three characters or less before expansion — `~/x` fits because it is exactly three characters and expands to `/home/hacker/x`.

---

### Level: Use a relative path from `/`
**Goal:** Change directory to `/` and run the challenge with a relative path starting with `c` (hint given by the level).

**Solution (bash):**
```bash
cd /
# relative path starting with 'c' that reaches /challenge/run:
challenge/run
# or explicitly using ./ to show current dir:
./challenge/run
```

**Thought process:** When cwd is `/`, a relative path `challenge/run` resolves to `/challenge/run`. Using `./challenge/run` is equivalent and demonstrates the `.` entry for the current directory.

---

### Level: Use `.` in paths
**Goal:** Show that `.` can be used in a path without changing the resolved target.

**Solution (bash):**
```bash
cd /
./challenge
./challenge/run
# or
challenge/.
challenge/./run
```

**Thought process:** Each `.` references the current directory, so inserting `.` between path components is allowed and will not alter the resolved path. This was helpful to illustrate path normalization and clarify how shells and the kernel treat `.` entries.

---

### Level: Command history flag
**Goal:** Recall earlier commands using the shell history to find a flag.

**Solution (interactive):** Press the up-arrow key (or run `history`) and re-run or inspect a previously executed command that printed the flag.

**Thought process:** The shell maintains a history of typed commands. Using the up-arrow is the quickest interactive way to retrieve previously entered commands; `history` or `~/.bash_history` also permit inspection.

# What I Learned / Key Takeaways

- **Absolute vs relative paths:** Absolute paths start with `/` and locate files from the filesystem root; relative paths are interpreted from the current working directory.
- **Tilde expansion:** `~` is expanded by the shell to the invoking user’s home directory (for example, `~/x` → `/home/hacker/x`). Only a leading `~` is expanded.
- **`.` and `..` path entries:** `.` refers to the current directory and can appear in paths without changing target resolution. `..` refers to the parent directory and is essential for stepping up the tree.
- **Command history is invaluable:** The shell's history reduces repetition and can reveal previously printed output or commands that produced flags.
- **Basic debugging:** When a path or binary isn't found, tools such as `ls -l`, `file`, and `find` are essential to inspect existence, permissions, and binary formats.
