# Challenge Name
type what the challenge asks

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{helloworld}`

Type in your solve and your thought process behind solving the challenge. Include as much info as possible.

### Commands I ran
```bash
# example triple ticks for bash
echo "pwn.college{helloworld}"
# (replace the above with the actual commands you used, e.g. cat, ls, find, diff, etc.)
```

### Thought process / writeup
- Step 1: Describe initial enumeration and what files or clues you saw.
- Step 2: Describe the commands used to interact with the filesystem (ls, cat, find, grep, diff, ln, etc.).
- Step 3: Explain how you isolated the real flag from decoys (for example: `diff decoys_only.txt decoys_and_real.txt` shows the extra line).
- Step 4: Show how you verified the flag and any post-check steps (running provided check scripts, cleaning up temporary files, etc.).

## What I learned
Explain what you learned (commands, concepts, gotchas). Example:
- Learned how to use `cat` to read files and `ls` to list directories.
- Used `grep` to search large files efficiently.
- Used `diff` to compare files and find differences that contained the real flag.
- Practiced using `find` to search the filesystem for hidden flag files.
- Learned about symlinks with `ln -s` and how challenge scripts may check for symlinked content.

## References
Add any references or videos you used while solving the challenge:
- pwn.college challenge description pages
- Linux command manuals (`man cat`, `man grep`, `man diff`, `man find`, `man ln`)
- Any writeups or videos you consulted (link or title)

## Notes / Template tips
- Replace the placeholder `pwn.college{helloworld}` in **My solve** with the actual flag you obtained.
- Replace the sample bash snippet with exact commands and outputs you ran (copy-paste terminal output if you want).
- Expand the "Thought process" with exact steps, observations, and why you took each action.
