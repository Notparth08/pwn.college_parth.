# Challenge Name
Invoking Commands, Arguments, and Command History

## What the challenge asks

- The first challenge teaches how to invoke a simple command in a Linux terminal and retrieve the flag by running the `hello` command.[web:5]
- The second challenge asks to invoke the `hello` command with a single argument: `hackers`.[web:5]
- The third challenge demonstrates fetching a flag from the command history using the up arrow key.[web:5]

## My Solve
pwn.college{helloworld}
pwn.college{hackers_are_cool}
pwn.college{from_the_history_bar}

**Thought Process:**

- For the first challenge, it was required to run the `hello` command on the terminal. After entering `hello`, the flag was printed out directly, demonstrating how command execution works on Linux.[web:5]
- The second challenge focused on command arguments. By typing `hello hackers`, the command processed the argument and returned a new flag, reinforcing how the first word is the command and any subsequent words are arguments.[web:5]
- The third challenge required using the up arrow key to access command history. Scrolling back through previously entered commands revealed a flag, helping learn about history navigation and its benefits for faster workflows.[web:5]

## What I Learned

- Commands in Linux are case sensitive, and entering the correct capitalization is essential for successful execution.[web:5]
- Most commands can accept arguments, which modify the behavior or output, and those arguments are separated by spaces.[web:5]
- The shell maintains a history of commands, accessible via arrow keys, allowing quick re-execution and memory aids for complex workflows.[web:5]
- The flags are used to verify the correct completion of these steps in the pwn.college platform.[web:5]
